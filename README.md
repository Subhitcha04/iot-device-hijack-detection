# IoT Anomaly Detection System

This repository contains a full-stack IoT anomaly detection system that simulates IoT traffic, preprocesses data, builds machine learning models for anomaly detection, and visualizes results using a React frontend. The backend uses Python for data processing, model building, and MQTT communication, while MongoDB stores the data.

## Project Setup

### 1. Preprocessing

First, preprocess the IoT traffic data to prepare it for model building. Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and preprocess the data.

To run the notebook:
```bash
# From the backend directory
jupyter notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb
```

This will generate the preprocessed dataset required for training the models.

### 2. Model Building

After preprocessing the data, build four machine learning models for anomaly detection: Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, and CNN. Each model is built in its respective Jupyter notebook.

1. **Decision Tree Model:**
    - Run the notebook to train the Decision Tree model:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook decision_tree_model.ipynb
    ```
    - The trained model will be saved as a `decision_tree_model.joblib` file for later use.

2. **SVM Model:**
    - Train the SVM model by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook svm_model.ipynb
    ```

3. **Naive Bayes Model:**
    - Train the Naive Bayes model by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook naive_bayes_model.ipynb
    ```

4. **CNN Model:**
    - Train the CNN model by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook cnn_model.ipynb
    ```

### 3. MQTT Communication

To simulate IoT data transmission via MQTT and run the backend anomaly detection service:

1. **Run IoT Device Simulation:**
    - Navigate to the `iot_device` directory:
    ```bash
    cd iot_device
    ```
    - Run the MQTT publisher to simulate the IoT device sending data:
    ```bash
    python mqtt_publisher.py
    ```

2. **Start the Backend Server:**
    - Open a new terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
    - Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Start the SVM MQTT Subscriber:**
    - In the same terminal, run the SVM subscriber to classify incoming IoT data:
    ```bash
    python svm_mqtt_subscriber.py
    ```

### 4. Frontend

The React frontend provides an interface for users to visualize the IoT data and anomaly detection results.

To set up and run the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `frontend/iot-anomaly-detection` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend/iot-anomaly-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and it can display the real-time IoT data and anomaly detection results.
